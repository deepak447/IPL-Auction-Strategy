-- Q6 : Now you need to get 2-3 All_rounders with the best batting as well as bowling strike rate
	-- and who have faced at least 500 balls in IPL so far and have bowled minimum 300
	-- balls.To do that you have to make a list of 10 players you want to bid in the auction so
	-- that when you try to grab them in auction you should not pay the amount greater than
	-- you have in the purse for a particular player.
